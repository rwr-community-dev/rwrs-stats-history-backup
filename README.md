# RWRS stats history backup

This repository contains two CSV files which are the database export of all the players' stats history on official **Invasion** and **WW2 DLCs** servers, as saved by the now-defunct [RWRS](https://github.com/EpocDotFr/rwrs) (rwrstats.com) project.

Stats history was only recorded for the 5000 most experienced players, and had a data retention policy of one year per RWR account, so not everyone will present in these files.
